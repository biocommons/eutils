QueryService -- provides eutils web requests
CachingQueryService -- subclass of above, with selectable caching
Client -- uses QS to 
EasyClient -- combine esearch + efetch



* make cache key less opaque

* central client interface -- single config point

* rich objects with dot notation access to elements
** careful distinguish variable content from structure
  e.g., gene.mapping[grch37p10][1], NOT gene.coords.grch37p10.exon1..
** pointer to client for method-based access to other functionality
  RefSeqGene.fetch_RefSeqProtein()

* Distinct Clients? XML and typed?

* esearch proxies that support iteration?

* client provides caching *XML* fetch replies (not objects) to mongo or sqlite (concurrency!)

* classes initialized from XML (for cachability)

* support flexible searches with arbitrary queries
  needs to be typed for return results (by db)

* expose link to generated query for debugging

* support history sessions

* client provides throttling? client singlton?
