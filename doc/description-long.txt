eutils (https://bitbucket.org/biocommons/eutils/) is a Python package
that facilitates the use of the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) Eutilities interface.  It is conceptually similar
to facilities in Biopython and PyCogent, but it differs from those in
a few important ways. Features:

* Eutils, and nothing else.  This reduces the number of dependencies.

* Caching and throttling are built-in. (NCBI bans excessive use.)

* Aims to provide parsers for all major data types.

Status: eutils is in early development.  PubMed, Gene, RefSeq
(nucleotide), and dbSNP data are well-represented; others are not
represented at all.
