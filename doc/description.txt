eutils is a Python package that facilitates the use of the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Eutilities interface.  It is
conceptually similar to facilities in Biopython and PyCogent, but it differs
from those in a few important ways. Features:

* Eutils, and nothing else.  This reduces the number of dependencies.

* Caching and throttling are built-in. (NCBI bans excessive use.)

* Aims to provide parsers for all major data types.




Status: eutils is in early development.  PubMed, Gene, RefSeq
(nucleotide), and dbSNP data are well-represented; others are not
represented at all.
