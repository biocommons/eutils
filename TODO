* doc, docstrings

* more tests! (See coverage)

* use tags to distinguish tests that require net connectivity from others
Net tests need to not use cache (easier when these are separated! -- #123)
But... commit cache into repo for non-net tests


* #122: implement TTL support in cache

* #123: refactor queryservice to separate querying, throttling, and caching
queryservice implements too much functionality. It should be refactored into:
a basic query service that executes queries, period
a thin throttling service based on the basic query service
a caching service on the throttled service (since that's all the caching service should use)
separate caching, throttling, querying, parsing/facades

* #124: Support large search result sets
support webenv history
use web history + iterators for chained searching
