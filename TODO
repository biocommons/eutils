* #121: update xmlfacades to better match xml tags and cardinality

* #122: implement TTL support in cache

* #123: refactor queryservice to separate querying, throttling, and caching
queryservice implements too much functionality. It should be refactored into:
a basic query service that executes queries, period
a thin throttling service based on the basic query service
a caching service on the throttled service (since that's all the caching service should use)
separate caching, throttling, querying, parsing/facades

* #124: support webenv history
use web history + iterators for chained searching

* #126: IndexError retrieving "comment" field from GBSeq object eutils

* #127: sqlite3 fails if directory ~/.cache is not previously created eutils
