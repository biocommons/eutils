-*-outline-*-

* initialize facades with xml node, not text
...then, GBSet -> GBSeq and initialize with correct root

* initialize facade with client object too

* assert expected node tag on initialization

* add functionality to facades objects

* add additional mehods to objects (like linking)

* chained searching -- iterate



* bigger stuff
separate caching, throttling, querying, parsing/facades
use web history + iterators
